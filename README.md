Users and computer can select their fighters. Based on their selection, they can use their special powers to win the game. Here are the fighters:


Mage: Has weak melee attacks. Has 2 magical attacks


Rogue: Strong melee attacks. Has 20% chance at landing critical hits


Tank: Medium melee attacks. Has tank armor that absorbs +5 damage every time she gets hit. Also, if she blocks while opponent triggers a special attack (Mage's magical attack or Rogue's critical hit), then the attack rebounds onto the opponent.
